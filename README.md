# Portfolio-Website
A website to store various projects

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a portfolio page which I can use to display and easily access my projects. The website was built from scratch, to reinforce and apply my knowledge of flexboxes, media queries and general HTML + CSS usage.

The website features a navigation bar, a header, and three sections titled 'About Me', 'Work' and 'Contact Me' respectively. The About Me section consists of text only; the Work section consists of clickable images with description cards - each representing a unique project; the Contact Me section consists of social media links, an email address and a phone number.   

## Installation

The project can be accessed at https://niktern.github.io/Portfolio-Website/

## Usage

The Navigation Bar links on the top right of the screen take you to the respective part of the website.

To access a project, click on the respective picture card (or the text box in front of a given picture). Placeholder projects may be used until there are enough projects to fill each link.

The 'Contact Me' links at the bottom of the page are also clickable.

Hovering over a Navigation Bar link should result in the text of that specific link becoming bolded, and changing colour.

Hovering over a given image in the Work section should result in its brightness increasing through a slow fade transition

Hovering over the name in the navigation bar should result in it changing colour.

## Credits

Colour palette inspiration derived from: https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palettes/summer-splash/

The placeholder text in the 'About Me' section derives from Friedrich Nietzsche's novel 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra', in the chapter 'On Reading and Writing'
